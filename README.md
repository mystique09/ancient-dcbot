# Discord bot
I was able to retrieve my old discord bot(not complete, as always I'm lazy af).
I found it in my mega clod drive, uploaded on June 2020 :smile:

>**Note**
>Dead project, obviously. I just want to put this on my repo, 'cause why not?

*What does this bot do?*
- prune messages
- ban user
- kick user
- user info(respond with embed "UserInfo", yeah dumb command)

Only 4 commands!? *yeah boi* I already told you I'm lazy.

*Why did you save this in your github repo?*
It's part of my self-taught journey, way back when I know nothing + no resources(still jobless tho).
